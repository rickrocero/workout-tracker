## Description
This application allows the user to track their workout progress so they can reach their fitness goals. The user can add exercises to the most recent workout plan and create a new workout plan. The user can view the combined weight of multiple exercises and the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the homepage or by navigating to the "Dashboard" to view their stats in a chart. The backend was built using Node.js, a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema, and express to handle API routes.
